## Overview

I’m broadly interested in universal structures in mathematics, how mathematical objects can be represented in computer languages, and how AI systems can support theorem proving and formal reasoning.

## Current Directions

1. **Representations of mathematics:** how to encode definitions, proofs, and abstractions in a way that is both precise and compositional.
2. **AI for theorem proving:** using machine learning and language models to guide search and generate proof artifacts.
3. **Connections to quantum information:** exploring formal structures and reasoning patterns that arise in quantum settings.
